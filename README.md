## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

Mobile -> ![](./screenshots/mobile.png)
Active -> ![](./screenshots/active.png)
Desktop -> ![](./screenshots/desktop.png)

## My process

Start with mobile view, then moved on to styling. Once all of that was completed, moved on to the desktop view. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I really wanted to focus on using proper html on this one, and not just styling everything in divs. Using Header tags, section tags and footer tags.
